> Remember kids, the only difference between screwing around and science is __*writing it down*__ -- Adam Savage, 2012

This blog is a record of all the Python projects that I've undertaken in the past year (2021). It's been quite a journey of self-enlightenment, especially in quarantine. I've done a lot of projects, some pretty serious, some not so much. However, I've recently decided that I should attempt to write this stuff down, not just so that I can show it off to others, but also so that I have a record of all the things I did to get here.

It's going to take a while for me to get to grips with the coding of the website. Github has been notoriously difficult for me to understand, which is surprising because it really shouldn't be, especially after all the Python and R that I've done. Well, here's my first attempt at starting up a blog, so hopefully it all turns out well. 

I also intend for this to be a contents page of sorts, at least until I have way too many projects to put here.

Anyway, I hope that you enjoy your time here! At the very least, I'll enjoy writing this stuff down, so there's at least one person who'll be happy for this blog's existence!
