## Testing out some Markdown capabilities
This is a test of the blog-making capabilities of GitHub.

First, let's test out writing some code using Markdown.

```python
print("Hello World")

def add(a, b):
  return a + b
```

That should have created a nice code block for starters. In fact, most of the keywords should be highlighted, just like in normal Python!

Just going to publish this and see if it works on the website itself.
